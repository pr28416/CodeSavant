France decided to begin deliberations on imposing a digital services tax in July 2019 on tech companies (both domestic and foreign) that provided users with digital services due to their frustration at the little success the European Union had in regulating technology giants such as Facebook, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), and Amazon. President Emmanuel Macron argued that tech companies were able to evade taxes while operating in France and were trying to acquire as much consumer data as possible, so he wanted to maintain that national sovereignty had supremacy over corporations.

Furthermore, this is all happening as tech companies such as Facebook are thrown into allegations of violating antitrust law from the European Commission. To expand from this, the United Kingdom has announced a plan to create a 2% tax on technology corporations, which is less than France’s proposed 3%. Ireland’s government has begun to intervene in order to ensure consumer data protection and prevent these American-based companies from violating privacy legislation. France’s government has become more desperate to accumulate revenue ever since they found it necessary to spend billions of euros appeasing protesters in 2018, and it has been found that this tax would generate between $500 to $600 million for them.

In response, the Trump administration decided to impose tariffs on European luxury goods in high demand by American consumers. Although many believed that they would not be as affected by the impact of tariffs, due to the presence of inelastic demand and less price sensitivity for these types of products, it has proven that it does not possess that kind of immunity. Given this, if exports of these luxury goods to the United States stay relatively the same, it is likely that the federal government would earn more revenue.
