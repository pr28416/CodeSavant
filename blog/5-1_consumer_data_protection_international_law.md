As technology companies such as Amazon and Facebook operate more and more through digital services and presence, the taxes levied by nations on their physical involvement do significantly less for those countries and their consumers. For example, with over four hundred million active users of the messaging platform WhatsApp in India alone, its parent company, Facebook, is able to circumvent Indian taxes while providing services to nearly a third of the nation’s population through digitization.

France and other nations have reasoned that multinational corporations with the ability to make profits off consumers through taking advantage of those consumers’ opportunity costs of spending time on digital platforms, allowing wide-scale online advertising campaigns, and being able to view and manipulate supposedly-protected consumer data.

In the United States, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has been responsible for protecting consumer financial information since 2011, but there has been dispute over whether this extends to consumer data protection, something that has also seen controversy involving the extent of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)’s jurisdiction on the issue.

However, in the European Union the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) within EU law creates limitations and statutes regarding the use of consumer data by companies that operate within the region. However, this system has long been criticized as one that costs European companies hundreds of billions of euros and American ones tens of billions of dollars, much to the chagrin of the United States Department of the Treasury, which is currently under the Trump administration.

France derives its new laws concerning digital privacy and taxing digital services from the GDPR, and the overall mechanism has spearheaded a massive domino effect of international law concerning technology and data protection. However, it must be pointed out that the French digital services tax, which has commonly been referred to as the “GAFA tax” (Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple) by trade officials, seems to single out certain companies and does not apply to all that are involved, to some degree, in the use of consumer data.

With France becoming increasingly protectionist surrounding the economics of data, many nations, especially within the European Union, have sought to curb what they deem as the “dangerous” influence of protectionist and isolationist trade policies by encouraging the creation of an international framework on consumer data protection through working with the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
