# Unit 3: Civil Liberties and Civil Rights

## Definitions

**Selective incorporation**: The process by which the Constitution effectively inserts parts of the Bill of Rights into state laws and constitutions.

**Incrementalism**: The process of incorporating specific rights and provisions of the Bill of Rights to the state level on a case-by-case basis.

**Total incorporation**: A doctrine that applies all the guarantees of the Bill of Rights to the state level without exception; this doctrine has never been adopted by a Supreme Court majority opinion, although several dissenting justices have advocated for it.

**Establishment clause**: Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion.

**Free exercise clause**: Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion.

**Lemon Test**: A test to determine whether a law violates the establishment clause devised by SCOTUS in the 1971 case Lemon v. Kurtzman.

* Laws are constitutional only if they have a legitimate secular purpose, neither advance nor inhibit religion, and do not result in an “excessive government entanglement” with religion.

**Nondenominational prayer**: Prayer that does not advocate the beliefs of a specific religion but that acknowledges the existence of a divine being.

**“Wall of separation” between church and state**: A phrase coined by Thomas Jefferson in an 1802 letter, which described his view that there should be complete separation between the government and religion.

**Espionage Act of 1917**: Outlawed interfering with military operations or recruitment, as well as supporting U.S. enemies during wartime.

**Clear and present danger test**: Permitted the government to punish speech likely to bring about evils that Congress had a right to prevent, such as stirring up anti-war sentiment. This has been replaced with the direct incitement test.

**Direct incitement test**: The government can only restrict speech when it’s likely to result in imminent lawless action, such as inciting mob violence.

**Defamation**: The act of damaging someone’s reputation by making false statements.

**Libel**: Printed defamation

**Slander**: Spoken defamation

**Hate speech**: Written or spoken communication that belittles a group based on its characteristics, such as race, gender, or sexual orientation.

**Obscenity**: Lewd or sexual art or publications. Although the Court has struggled to define what constitutes obscenity, it has upheld restrictions on materials that “to the average person applying contemporary community standards” depict offensive or sexual conduct and lack literary or artistic merit.

**Symbolic speech**: Nonverbal forms of speech protected by the 1st amendment.

**Time, place, and manner restrictions**: Limits to freedom of expression based on when, where, and how individuals or organizations express opinions. For example, a city may require an organization to obtain a permit in order to conduct a public protest.

**Prior restraint**: Government censorship of materials before publication takes place. It is likely the Court will declare an act of government that blocks free expression unconstitutional.

**Miranda warnings**: “You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law…”

**Public safety exception**: An exception to the Miranda rule; it allows the police to perform unwarned interrogation and have the findings stand as direct evidence in court, provided the information relates to public safety.

**Right to legal counsel**: The right to have the assistance of a lawyer; protected under the 6th amendment.

**Right to speedy and public trial**: Protects a defendant from having a long delay between being arrested and facing trial; protected under the 6th amendment.

**Right to an impartial jury**: The defendant has the right to face a jury that is not likely to have an opinion about the case already formed; protected under the 6th amendment.

**Exclusionary rule**: A requirement that any evidence found during an illegal search or seizure cannot be used to try someone for a crime.

**Structural barriers**: Policies, practices, and other norms that favor an advantaged group while systematically disadvantaging a marginalized group

**Majority-minority districts**: Congressional districts with boundaries set so that the majority of voters are from one minority group. The aim of creating districts in this way is to make it easier for citizens of a racial or ethnic minority to elect a representative who reflects their concerns, and to prevent their 
collective votes from being diluted when spread across several different districts.

**Affirmative action**: Efforts to improve opportunities for underrepresented or disadvantaged groups, especially in relation to employment or education.

**The “colorblind” Constitution**: The belief that the Constitution protects citizens of all races equally, and that additional measures such as affirmative action are unnecessary.

**Equal protection clause**: A provision of the 14th amendment that prohibits states from denying equal protection of the laws to their residents.
