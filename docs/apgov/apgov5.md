## Definitions

**Party-line voting**: Supporting a party by voting for candidates from one political party for all public offices at the same level of government.

**Rational choice voting**: Voting based on what is perceived to be in the citizen’s individual interest.

**Retrospective voting**: Voting to decide whether the party or candidate in power should be re-elected based on the recent past.

**Prospective voting**: Voting based on predictions of how a party or candidate will perform in the future.

**Poll tax**: A fixed-sum tax payable by all relative individuals, such as all residents of a state; used as a precondition to registering to vote in order to discourage certain groups (e.g. African Americans) from participation.

**Political efficacy**: A citizen’s belief that their vote matters and can influence government policies.

**Compulsory voting**: Laws that require citizens to register and vote in local and national elections.

**Midterm elections**: The congressional elections that occur in even-numbered years between presidential elections, in the middle of each presidential term.

**Presidential elections**: Elections that take place every four years, in which voters elect the president and the vice-president.

**Voter registration**: A requirement that eligible voters enroll on an electoral roll before they can vote.

**Voter turnout**: The number of registered voters who vote in an election.

**Demographics**: Characteristics of a population, like age, race, and education. Political scientists use demographic information to study changes in the makeup of a population.

**Linkage institutions**: Groups in society that connect people to the government and facilitate turning the people’s concerns into political issues on the government’s policy agenda.

**Political party**: An organization of people with similar political ideologies that seeks to influence public policy by getting its candidates elected.

**Party platform**: A list of goals outlining a party’s positions on issues and political priorities.

**Party organization**: Structure of national, state, and local parties that creates a platform, recruits candidates, and helps to manage candidates’ campaigns by providing a fundraising and media strategy.

**Party in government**: Elected officials who belong to the party.

**Party in the electorate**: All the citizens who identify with that party.

**Candidate-centered campaigns**: Political campaigns that focus on the candidates for office—their personalities and issues— rather than the parties they represent. Since the 1930s, candidate-centered campaigns have predominated in American politics.

**Critical election**: An election that leads to a major party realignment. After a critical election, a number of key supporters of one party switch to the other party.

**Dealignment**: The process by which an individual loses his or her loyalty to a political party without developing loyalty to another party.

**Direct primary**: The current process by which voters choose their party’s candidate for national office. Direct primaries have replaced party-controlled mechanisms for choosing candidates.

**Micro-targeting**: The growing practice of using computer models to identify voters who might support a candidate. Campaigns pay firms to mine consumer data, census records, and voting behavior in order to supply them with names of potential voters.

**Political machine**: A party organization with the goal of enriching party leaders, party workers, and citizen supporters through government contracts and jobs.

**Political action committee (PAC)**: An organization, usually representing an interest group or corporation, that raises money with the goal of supporting or defeating candidates, parties, or legislation. There are limits to the amount of money a PAC can donate to a candidate or party in each election.

**Realignment**: A major change in the composition of party coalitions, often brought on by a new or pressing issue (often economic trouble or war). For example, the Great Depression led many African Americans to leave the Republican Party and join the Democratic Party in the 1932 election, permanently changing each party’s base of supporters.

**Super PAC / Independent expenditure-only committee**: Can raise unlimited funds in support of a candidate or party as long as they do not coordinate in any way with the candidate or party.

**Independent candidate**: A candidate for office who does not have a formal affiliation with a political party.

**Party platform**: A set of goals supported by a political party. Parties design their platforms to appeal to the concerns of the public and to encourage voters to support the party.

**Proportional system**: An electoral system in which legislative seats are awarded in proportion to the percentage of votes garnered by a party in an election. This system is common in Europe and benefits minor political parties, who may win a smaller number of legislative seats even if a mainstream party wins most seats.

**Third party**: A US political party other than the Democrats and GOP. They influence national politics by drawing attention to issues previously neglected by the major parties.

**Two-party system**: An electoral system in which two major parties dominate voting at all levels of government.

**Winner-take-all system**: An electoral system in which legislative seats are awarded only to the party who received the most votes in an election. This is the most common system in the United States, and it does not benefit minor political parties, since third-party candidates rarely win the majority of votes in an election.

**“Free rider” problem**: A problem of group behavior that occurs when an individual can receive a public benefit without making a personal contribution of money or effort. For example, a person might listen to public radio but never contribute to the station, assuming that other donors will pay to keep it operating.

**Interest group**: A formal or informal association of people seeking to influence governmental policy in favor of their interests; interest groups may represent social causes, economic and corporate interests, or religious and ideological interests.

**Iron triangle**: A longstanding, mutually-beneficial relationship between an interest group, congressional committee, and bureaucratic agency devoted to similar issues; for example the American Association of Retired Persons, the Congressional Subcommittee on Aging, and the Social Security Administration all work closely together on issues related to senior citizens.

**Issue network**: A group of individuals, public officials, and interest groups that form around a particular issue, usually a proposed public policy that they wish to support or defeat.

**Lobbying**: Seeking to influence a public official on an issue

**Inside strategies**: Interest groups’ attempts to influence policy by working within Washington DC. This includes strategies like direct lobbying, drafting pieces of legislation for elected officials, and suing the government.

**Outside strategies**: Interest groups’ attempts to influence policy outside of Washington DC, by using strategies like campaign contributions, media coverage, or encouraging constituents to contact their elected officials.

**Protest movement**: A group that brings attention to a social problem through public demonstrations or other forms of direct action.

**Salience**: The degree to which the general public is aware of a policy issue. Policymakers are less likely to accommodate the demands of interest groups on issues with high salience, like gun rights or abortion rights, as they risk alienating voters.

**Single-issue group**: An interest group devoted to one particular issue rather than a larger category of interests.

**Social movements**: Groups that work to bring about change in society, such as the Civil Rights Movement or the Environmental Movement; these groups support policies and elected officials that align with their beliefs.

**Caucus**: A meeting in a voting precinct at which party members choose nominees for political office after hours of speeches and debates; caucuses tend to promote the views of dedicated party members since participating requires a large time commitment.

**Closed primary**: A primary election limited to registered members of a political party; for example, in a state with closed primaries, only registered Democrats can vote in the Democratic primary to choose candidates for local, state and national office.

**Electoral college**: The group of electors chosen by each state to formally vote for the next U.S. president based on the result of voting in the state.

**General election**: An election that decides which candidate will fill an elective.

**Incumbency advantage**: The tendency of incumbents to win reelection; incumbents have advantages in media exposure, fundraising, and staff.

**Open primary**: A primary election that is not limited to registered party members. For example, in a state with open primaries, independent voters or Republicans can vote in the Democratic primary to choose candidates for local, state, and national office.

**Nonpartisan blanket primary**: A primary election in which all candidates, regardless of their respective political party, run against each other at once, instead of being segregated by political party. Multiple winners are selected and become the contestants in the general election, in a two-round system.

**Party convention**: A meeting of delegates from one political party to vote on policy and select party candidates for public office.

**Popular vote**: The total or percentage of votes won by each candidate.

**Primary election**: An election that decides which candidate a party will send on to a general election; primary elections pit candidates from the same party against one another.

**Winner-takes-all**: An electoral system in which the candidate with the most votes is elected or, in the case of the U.S. Electoral College, gains all the votes of a state or district’s electors.

**Midterm election**: An election that takes place in the middle of a presidential term. Midterm elections tend to have much lower voter turnout than presidential elections and often result in the loss of congressional seats for the president’s party.

**Campaign finance**: The fundraising to support a candidate in their run for political office.

**Political consultants**: People who promote the election of candidates for political office by helping advise candidates on how best to present their ideas to the public.

**Hard money**: Money spent directly in support of a candidate. This is regulated.

**Soft money**: Money spent in support of a candidate without directly donating to their campaign, such as paying for ads or campaign events, or giving to the candidate’s party.

**“Stand by Your Ad” provision**: A provision of the Bipartisan Campaign Act of 2002 which requires ads used to support or oppose a candidate to include this line: “I’m [candidate’s name] and I approve this message.”

**“Horse race” journalism**: Journalism that focuses on who is winning or ahead in the polls rather than on candidates’ policy agenda or debates.

**Investigative journalism**: Deep, original investigation on a specific topic, often conducted over a long period of time and sometimes involving the exposure of secret information.

**“Media as a gatekeeper”**: The media’s role in setting the political agenda by drawing public and government attention to certain issues.

**Agenda-setting**: The way the media influences what issues the public considers important enough to address through the government.

**Citizen journalist**: A person who reports on current events who is not trained in journalism or affiliated with a news outlet. Social media and smartphones have facilitated the rise of citizen journalists.

**Framing**: The way the media defines and portrays an issue, which affects public perception of that issue.

**Ideologically-oriented programming**: TV and radio news programs that cater to audiences with a particular ideological perspective.

**Media consolidation**: The process by which a few large companies have acquired the majority of news sources in the U.S. Today, 6 companies (CBS, Comcast, Disney, News Corporation, Time Warner, and Viacom) control 90% of American media outlets.

**Partisan news sites**: Websites and blogs that cater to audiences with a particular ideological perspective.
