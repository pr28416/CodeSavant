# Unit 1: Foundations of American Democracy

## Definitions

**Social contract**: An implicit agreement among members of a society to cooperate for social benefits, for example by sacrificing some individual freedom for state protection.

**Democracy (popular sovereignty)**: People choose leadership; govern through fair representation, prevent abuses of power. Fair and free elections, civic participation, human rights protections, law and order.

**Republicanism**: Elected leaders represent the interests of the people in government.

**Limited government**: Political system in which there are certain restrictions placed on the government to protect individual rights and liberties.

**Natural rights**: The right to life, liberty, and property, which no government may take away.

**Participatory democracy**: A form of democracy that emphasizes broad, direct participation in politics and civil society, in which most or all citizens participate in politics directly.
* Benefits: Representing the people well - directly involved.
* Disadvantages: With a larger population, it is more difficult to get everyone informed or interested in issues - does it scale?

**Pluralist democracy**: Many different interests that will compete with each other to influence policy. There are interest groups and lobbyists trying to convince Congress that their views are right.
* Benefits:
    * Good ideas surface from vigorous debate
    * No domination by one party
* Disadvantages:
    * Slow/no decisions (gridlock) - you have to make too many people happy, it’s very hard to make everyone happy

**Elite democracy**: A small number of people, usually those who are wealthy and well-educated, influence political decision making.
* Benefits:
    * The elite may be more educated than the general public; allows them to make more informed decisions on more complex issues.
    * More decisive than pluralist or participatory democracies - a smaller group could potentially more easily make decisions
* Disadvantages:
    * Are they representative of the population? Representative democracy or oligarchy?

**Democratic republic**: A system of government in which the power to govern comes from the people, but elected officials represent their interests.

**Initiative**: Process that allows citizens to bypass their state legislature by placing proposed laws on the ballot.

**Popular referendum**: Allows voters to approve or repeal an act of the state legislature.

**Articles of Confederation**: First U.S. constitution; placed most power in the hands of state governments; U.S. economy faltered, since the central government lacked the power to enforce tax laws or regulate commerce. Shays’s Rebellion illustrated the need to create a stronger governing system.

**Confederation Congress**: Central government under AOC. Each state had 1 vote. The Articles required 9/13 states to vote to approve any measure, and 13/13 states to vote in order to amend the Articles.

**Electoral college**: People would vote in each state. The state would then have electors who cast votes for the president. It was intended as a safeguard against having an inadequate leader being voted for by the people, who could potentially be swayed by demagoguery.

**Three-Fifths compromise**: Slaves are regarded as ⅗ of a citizen when counted in the census for government representation and taxation.

**Great compromise**: Established two houses - House of representatives and Senate
* House of reps: Proportional representation
* Senate: Equal representation

**Writ of Habeas Corpus**: A fundamental right in the Constitution that protects against unlawful and indefinite imprisonment. A public official must deliver an imprisoned individual to the court and show a valid reason for that person's detention.

**Bill of Attainder**: An act of a legislature declaring a person, or a group of persons, guilty of some crime, and punishing them, often without a trial.

**Ex post facto law**: A law that changes the legal status or consequences of an action after it has already been done, especially a law that makes an action illegal after it has been committed. These are prohibited by the U.S. Constitution.

**Bill of Rights**: First 10 amendments to the Constitution. Designed to protect individual rights and liberties.

**Congressional proposal method**: Method of amending the Constitution. ⅔ of both chambers of Congress must propose an amendment. It must then be ratified by ¾ of state conventions or state legislatures.

**Convention method**: Method of amending the Constitution. ⅔ of states ask Congress to organize a convention. An amendment is proposed. It must then be ratified by ¾ of state conventions/legislatures. Has never been used.

## Events

**1776, Declaration of Independence**

Statement from the United States of specific grievances with the British monarchy and why they were going to create a separate government.

**1776, Articles of Confederation**

First U.S. constitution. Bound the states together in a loose “league of friendship” that permitted the states to retain nearly all government power. It could coin money, direct the post office, and negotiate with foreign powers. It could only request that states provide all else.

**1787, Shays’s Rebellion**

Uprising of Massachusetts farmers after they faced imprisonment and loss of lands for being in debt after the war. Showed the weakness inherent in the Articles of Confederation. Highlighted the weakness of not having a central government to have a military, negotiate debt with foreign countries, and tax citizens.

**1787, Constitutional Convention**

Representatives from the states met in Philadelphia to create a new stronger government that would be powerful but not tyrannical.

**1819, McCulloch v. Maryland**

Addressed the question:

* Does the federal government have the power to charter a national bank? Can a state tax it?

Decision: Yes, the federal government has the power to charter a national bank. No, a state cannot tax it.

* Article 1, Section 8, Clause 18 - Necessary and proper clause
* Even though the power wasn’t enumerated, the federal government could still do it to accomplish an enumerated power.
* Article 6, Clause 2 (Supremacy clause): The state can’t get in the way of the federal government
* Reinforced the power of the federal government - this implied power was constitutional.

**1995, U.S. v. Lopez**

Addressed the question:

* Is the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 unconstitutional?

Decision: Yes, the commerce clause does not grant the federal government the power to establish this act.

## Documents

**1776, Declaration of Independence**

Explains the reasons why the 13 Colonies desired independence from Great Britain. The ideals for government expressed in the Declaration, including popular sovereignty and social contract, serve as the inspiration for American democratic values.
* *“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”*

**1787, U.S. Constitution**

A blueprint for how American government functions. Establishes the 3 separate branches of the U.S. government (legislative, executive, and judicial) and describes the relationship between the states and the federal government. It restricts the powers of the government and establishes an election process for republicanism.
* *“We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution.”*

**1787, Brutus No. 1**

An Anti-Federalist essay which argued against a strong central government based on the belief that it would not be able to meet the needs of all U.S. citizens.

* Small republics are successful; large republics are tyrannical, as seen with the Roman empire.
* Anti-pluralism - too many views that make the large country ungovernable.
* Interests of the people should be similar; otherwise, nothing will ever get done in government.
* Representatives are going to be detached from the people they’re representing because they are representing larger groups of people, and they may begin to abuse their power and aggrandize themselves.

**1787, Federalist No. 10**

An essay written by James Madison, in which he argued that a strong representative government would be able to control the effects of factions.

* Participatory democracy isn’t adequate in preventing the majority from overtaking the minority
* A republic is better for ruling over a greater number of people - large republic is better
* Pro-elite representative democracy
* Pro-pluralism - no one group dominates
* It’ll be harder to corrupt government - better choice of candidates, each has to appeal to a large group of people

**1788, Federalist No. 51**

* An essay written by James Madison, in which he argued that checks and balances and separation of powers in the government ensure that the government doesn’t have too much power. This would make power grabs harder.
* *“What is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.”*
