For the past few years, China has been resisting the United Statesâ€™ requests for a free trade zone that allows cloud computing companies and services to operate without as many limitations and restrictions as before, and without heavy involvement and investigation by the Chinese government. The United States is asking that the Chinese government protects intellectual property rights, and although the latter has cited reasons pertaining to national security for its previous refusals, it is slowly loosening its regulations.

Large American tech companies such as Microsoft and Amazon are expanding big data centers and cloud computing services in China, as the Chinese government begins to refrain from forcing American firms to transfer technological secrets to Chinese companies and state-owned industries. What this means is that China is aiming to pacify the United States with new laws that prohibit theft and exploitation of foreign trade secrets, something the government itself has done numerous times in the past.

State-owned entities, such as those controlled by China, tend to enjoy many advantages over private technology firms because they can draw money from governments funds to offer financing at attractive interest rates. Many companies in the tech sector, such as Nokia, are thriving in American markets due to lack of domestic competitor firms. Lack of competitors in the United States may be a signal that the manufacturing sector of the nation is not as strong as it used to be, as Americans shift toward services and depend on international markets to satisfy needs for wireless communications that replaced incompatible technologies from old American firms.

The market share, especially in the electronic technology industry, is being controlled increasingly by China-based corporations that use state funds to ensure financing of their products at below the market price. This decreased cost of goods and services makes foreign products appealing to largely consumer nations, and the United States is not involved in such methods of export. If the United States and China fail to reach a significant trade deal soon that binds China to American demands, then state-owned industries will become more competitive and monopolistic in global markets, and even if the United States is able to regulate how the Chinese government and state-owned industries negotiate with American tech companies, these foreign companies can still receive financing and push the United States further out of international markets.
